      hide_status: >
        Activating this option makes your online status invisible
        for all other members except moderators and administrators.
      language: >
        Main board display language. All system messages will be shown
        to you in this language; it has (of course) no influence on
        the language other people use in their postings.
      markup_language: >
        This is the default markup language that will be selected for
        new postings you are creating.
      time_format: >
        Force this time format to be used everywhere. If blank,
        a default time format will be used that fits the respective
        place. The format is determined by date(1).
      gravatar: >
        If you enable this, your email address will be used to
        query the Gravatar service for your avatar image instead
        of using the avatar image uploaded to this forum.
      avatar: >
        You can use this form to upload a small picture that is
        shown next to your postings. This has no effect if you
        have enabled the “use gravatar” option.

    merge_info: >
      Using this form you can merge two topics into one. The posts are
      inserted into the topic in their chronological order, which means
      that the later you merge, the more confusion you will generate.
      The topic you execute the merge on will be deleted in favour of
      the target topic. In the field below, enter the ID of the target
      topic you want to merge with (you can find this out by looking at
      your browser’s URL bar when in the target topic).

    split_info: >
      Submitting this form will split the selected topic from the requested
      topic on into two ones. The new topic will be created with the title
      you give below, and will be placed in the same forum as the old topic
      (you can move it later if you need). The post you selected “split” on
      will be the first post of the new topic.

      hide_status: >
        Activating this option makes your online status invisible
        for all other members except moderators and administrators.
      language: >
        Main board display language. All system messages will be shown
        to you in this language; it has (of course) no influence on
        the language other people use in their postings.
      markup_language: >
        This is the default markup language that will be selected for
        new postings you are creating.
      time_format: >
        Force this time format to be used everywhere. If blank,
        a default time format will be used that fits the respective
        place. The format is determined by date(1).
      gravatar: >
        If you enable this, your email address will be used to
        query the Gravatar service for your avatar image instead
        of using the avatar image uploaded to this forum.
      avatar: >
        You can use this form to upload a small picture that is
        shown next to your postings. This has no effect if you
        have enabled the “use gravatar” option.
      signature: >

      Use this form to report a posting to the moderators. This
      is a rude action as you blame somebody for doing something,
      so you are asked to provide a reason for reporting (e.g. spam,
      violation of forum rules, etc.).

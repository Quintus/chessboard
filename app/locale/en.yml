      Using this form you can merge two topics into one. The posts are
      inserted into the topic in their chronological order, which means
      that the later you merge, the more confusion you will generate.
      The topic you execute the merge on will be deleted in favour of
      the target topic. In the field below, enter the ID of the target
      topic you want to merge with (you can find this out by looking at
      your browser’s URL bar when in the target topic).

      Submitting this form will split the selected topic from the requested
      topic on into two ones. The new topic will be created with the title
      you give below, and will be placed in the same forum as the old topic
      (you can move it later if you need). The post you selected “split” on
      will be the first post of the new topic.

      This page lists all bans imposed on people using this forum.
      If someone whose IP, nickname, or email address tries to log
      into the forum, he will be rejected; if you ban someone who
      is logged in currently, he will be kicked without being able
      to log in afterwards. Be careful with general patterns; if you
      accidentally ban all moderators/administrators only someone
      with database access will be able to lift the ban again.

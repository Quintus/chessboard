      accept: "I have read and accept the <a href='/rules'>forum rules</a>."
      must_accept: "You have to accept the forum rules."
      version: "Forum rules version:"
      version_desc: >-
        The current version of the forum rules. This value is
        important when you want to look up which version of the
        forum rules a user originally accepted when registering.
        You can use any characters you like here, you donâ€™t
        have to number your rules versions from 1 upwards. Just ensure
        you use a unique value for each version of your forum rules.
      content: "Forum rules content:"
      content_desc: >-
        Contents of the forum rules. This is raw HTML that will
        be pasted as-is onto the forum rules page. For use in court
        it is highly recommended that you save old versions of
        your forum rules together with the version string you
        specified above somewhere so you have them readily accessible
        if needed.
      must_specify_version: "You have to specify a forum rules version."
      must_specify_content: "You have to specify the forum rules text."
      no_rules_specified: "No forum rules specified yet."

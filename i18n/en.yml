    Using this form you can merge two topics into one. The posts are
    inserted into the topic in their chronological order, which means
    that the later you merge, the more confusion you will generate.
    The topic you execute the merge on will be deleted in favour of
    the target topic. In the field below, enter the ID of the target
    topic you want to merge with (you can find this out by looking at
    your browser’s URL bar when in the target topic).

    topic on into two ones. The new topic will be created with the title
    you give below, and will be placed in the same forum as the old topic
    (you can move it later if you need). The post you selected “split” on
    will be the first post of the new topic.

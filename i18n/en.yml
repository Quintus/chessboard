  desc1: >
    Use this form to perform a search against the posts database.
  desc2: >
    The search field accepts special key-value pairs that have the following
    meanings:
  desc3: >
    Everything that does not match one of these key-value pairs is considered
    a keyword to search for. Multiple keywords are connected with a logical AND,
    i.e. all of them have to be found in a post for it to be included into the result
    set.
  keys:
    alias:
      syntax: "alias:PATTERN"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to those posts that were made under an
        alias that contains PATTERN. The difference to “author” is that
        this is matched against the alias the post was made under, whereas
        “author” specifies the unchangable ID of a user, which may
        be different if he changed his current alias since he made the post.
    after:
      syntax: "after:TIME"
      desc: >
        Only consider posts that were created after the given TIME. The
        TIME argument should be of form “YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM", where the “T”
        is literal, e.g. “2015-02-03T15:06”. The time has to be given as UTC.
    announcement:
      syntax: "announcement:yes|no"
      desc: >
        Only search announcements.
    author:
      syntax: "author:ID"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to those posts that were made by the
        user with the specified ID (can be seen in the URL bar when you're
        visiting a user's profile page).
    before:
      syntax: "before:TIME"
      desc: >
        Only consider posts that were created before the given TIME.
        See the description of “after” for an explanation of the format
        to use for TIME.
    forum:
      syntax: "forum:ID"
      desc: >
        Only search posts that were made in the forum with the given numerical
        ID. You can see this ID in the URL bar of your browser when you are
        in a forum.
    htmlonly:
      syntax: "htmlonly:yes|no"
      desc: >
        This useless option restricts the result set to posts that were
        received as HTML-only messages. Maybe useful for naming and shaming.
    limit:
      syntax: "limit:COUNT"
      desc: >
       Do not return a result of more than COUNT posts. Count may not be greater
       than 100.
    maxviews:
      syntax: "maxviews:COUNT"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to posts that have been viewed less or equal to
        COUNT times. Cannot be combined with “minviews”.
    minviews:
      syntax: "minviews:COUNT"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to posts that have been viewed COUNT or more
        times. Cannot be combined with “maxviews”.
    msgid:
      syntax: "msgid:MSGID"
      desc: >
        Search for a message with exactly this MSGID, where MSGID is the
        email's message ID, which in turn is the value of the “Message-ID”
        email header. This option is not useful to combine with any other one.
    onlycontent:
      syntax: "onlycontent:yes|no"
      desc: >
        Search only the posts' contents. Cannot be combined with “onlytitle“.
    onlytitle:
      syntax: "onlytitle:yes|no"
      desc: >
        Search only the posts' titles. Cannot be combined with “onlycontent“.
    order:
      syntax: "order:asc|desc"
      desc: >
        Order the result by date ascending (“asc”) or descending (“desc”). If
        this option is not passed, orders by date descending by default.
        “Ascending” means the oldest result comes first, “descending” means
        the newest result comes first.
    root:
      syntax: "root:yes|no"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to thread starters.
    sticky:
      syntax: "sticky:yes|no"
      desc: >
        Restrict the result set to sticky posts.

    email: >-
      Change your e-mail address to another one. Simply leave this as-is if
      you do not want to change it. Note that if you do change it and
      afterwards post to the actual mailinglist using an email program,
      you have to use that new email address as the sender, otherwise
      your post will not be associated with your account as Chessboard
      is tightly coupled with the mailinglist management software.
    view_mode: >
      Chessboard is capable to display the discussions in either thread or
      topic view. The thread view resembles the classic hierarchical
      ordering, where the posts are indented to indicate who replied to whom.
      The topic view is a simplified version that ignores the reply chain and
      instead just sorts all posts in a discussion by date, without indentation.
      The thread view offers more functionality, while the topic view might be
      simpler to use.

    Deleting your account removes you from this board
    and unsubscribes you from any mailinglists associated
    with it (even if you subscribed to them separately with
    the email address you gave here). It does not delete
    the your posts as this forum serves as a mailinglist archive.
    If you want your posts to be deleted together with your account,
    please contact the administration at %1 instead of using this
    deletion form.

  creation_failed: >
    Your post could not be created. This might be due to the email infrastructure
    having problems (in which case your post is likely to show up later when
    things are back to normal), or you may have been banned from the mailinglist.
    If you are unsure, you can contact the board administration at %1.

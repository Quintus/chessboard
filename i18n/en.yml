    The topic you execute the merge on will be deleted in favour of
    the target topic. In the field below, enter the ID of the target
    topic you want to merge with (you can find this out by looking at
    your browser’s URL bar when in the target topic).

    will be the first post of the new topic.

      If this option is active, your email address will not be shown
      on your profile page (board staff can still see it).
    auto_watch: >-
      Automatically watch all topics you create or reply to.
    language: >
      Main board display language. All system messages will be shown
      to you in this language; it has (of course) no influence on

    password: >

    email: >-
      Change your e-mail address to another one. Simply leave this as-is if
      you do not want to change it. Note that if you do change it and
      afterwards post to the acutal mailinglist using an email program,
      you have to use that new email address as the sender, otherwise
      your post will not be associated with your account as Chessboard
      is tightly coupled with the mailinglist management software.

  password_mismatch: Password does not match repetition.
  delete_account: Delete Your Account

  # %1 is replaced with the board's admin email address.
  delete_account_desc: >-
    Deleting your account removes you from this board
    and unsubscribes you from any mailinglists associated
    with it (even if you subscribed to them separately with
    the email address you gave here). It does not delete
    the your posts as this forum serves as a mailinglist archive.
    If you want your posts to be deleted together with your account,
    please contact the administration at %1 instead of using this
    deletion form.
